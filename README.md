# Pygame University Homework

This repository contains the solution for a university assignment focused on adding new features to existing Pygame examples.

## Project Description

The assignment required selecting and implementing 6 features from a provided list into various Pygame programs based on the "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python" book.

## Implemented Tasks

Based on the assignment instructions, the following 6 tasks were selected and implemented:

1.  **catanimation.py:**
   - Extend the game by adding second cat with different directions. \
     Each cat should move independently and bounce off the edges of the screen
