# Pygame University Homework

This repository contains the solution for a university assignment focused on adding new features to existing Pygame examples.

## Project Description

The assignment required selecting and implementing 6 features from a provided list into various Pygame programs based on the "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python" book.

## Implemented Tasks

Based on the assignment instructions, the following 6 tasks were selected and implemented:

1.  **catanimation.py:**
   - Extend the game by adding second cat with different directions. \
     Each cat should move independently and bounce off the edges of the screen

2.  **wormy.py:**
   - Add a feature to display a "Pause" message and pause \
     the game when the player presses the P key. (unpauses on any key) \

5.  **inkspill.py:**
     - Add a feature to display the number of moves the player has made during the game in the top-left corner of the screen. \

6.  **gemgem.py:**
     - Add a feature to display a timer at the top of the screen that counts down from a set time limit (e.g., 2 minutes). When the timer reaches zero, the game ends. \

## Setup and Running

1.  **Install Python:** If you don't have Python installed, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2.  **Install Pygame:** Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```
3.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KacperPach/SDG-ZADANIA/
    cd SDG-ZADANIA
    ```
4.  **Run a Program:** Navigate into the repository directory and run any of the modified example files using Python. For example:
    ```bash
    python catanimation.py
    ```
    Replace `catanimation.py` with the name of the file you want to run.
